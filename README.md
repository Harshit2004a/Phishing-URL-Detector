This Phishing URL Detector uses machine learning to analyze website links and determine whether they are legitimate ðŸŸ¢ or phishing ðŸ”´.

## How It Works:
- Loads a dataset of phishing and legitimate URLs.
- Extracts patterns using TF-IDF (Text Feature Extraction).
- Trains a Random Forest Classifier with optimized parameters.
- Calculates model accuracy before making predictions.
- Allows users to enter a URL to check if itâ€™s phishing or safe.

## Why Use This?
1. Fast & Reliable â€“ Detects phishing URLs in seconds
2. AI-Powered â€“ Uses machine learning for intelligent detection
### 3. Continuously Improves â€“ Can be trained on new data for better accuracy
